Function Sheets 2.0 - Dashboard like tool to use for hotels/ event staff

## Intention

Artemis is dashboard like approach for replacing a tool called "Function Sheets". A function sheet is mostly a sheet of paper, which describes an event at a hotel for one day. It holdes information about the amount of people expected, the booked rooms, the setup, the ordered food & beverages and more.

Its usally a big mess to spread the newest information to the colleagues. Why not using a tool, everyone have now. Your Phone.

## How to use

## The design

Because the prototyp would be used as part of an enterprise software, why not branding it for the company buying it. In my example IHG, one of the biggest hotel companies on the planet. Okay its not Marriott. But they are still huge.
